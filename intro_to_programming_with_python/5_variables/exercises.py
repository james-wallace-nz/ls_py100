# 1. Classify the following potential non-constant variable names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal. For the non-idiomatic and illegal names, explain your choice.

# quick_Fox
# 1stCharacter
# operand2

# 2. Classify the following potential function names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal. For the non-idiomatic and illegal names, explain your choice.

# Name
# index
# CatName
# lazy_dog
# quick_Fox
# 1stCharacter

# π


# 3. Classify the following potential constant names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal. For the non-idiomatic and illegal names, explain your choice.

# Name
# index
# CatName
# snake_case
# LAZY_DOG3
# 1ST

# 5. Write a program named greeter.py that greets 'Victor' three times. Your program should use a variable and not hard code the string value 'Victor' in each greeting. Here's an example run of the program:

# $ python greeter.py
# Good Morning, Victor.
# Good Afternoon, Victor.
# Good Evening, Victor.


# 6. Write a program named age.py that includes someone's age and then calculates and reports the future age 10, 20, 30, and 40 years from now. Here's the output for someone who is 22 years old.

# You are 22 years old.
# In 10 years, you will be 32 years old.
# In 20 years, you will be 42 years old.
# In 30 years, you will be 52 years old.
# In 40 years, you will be 62 years old.


# 7. What happens when you run the following code? Why?

# NAME = 'Victor'
# print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

# NAME = 'Nina'
# print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)


# 8. Challenge: This program uses a bit of math. Don't let that scare you away -- try it anyway.

# Assume you have $1,000.00 in the bank, and you've somehow managed to find a bank that pays you 5% (this is a wish-fulfillment fantasy) compounded interest every year. After one year, you will have $1,050 ($1,000 times 1.05). After two years, you will have $1,050 times 1.05, or $1102.50. Create a variable named balance that contains the amount of money you will have after 5 years, then print the result. Use a single expression if you can to set balance to the correct value.


# 9. Repeat the previous question but, this time, use augmented assignment to compute the final result, one year at a time.


# 10. Assume that obj already has a value of 42 when the code below starts running. Which of the subsequent statements reassign the variable? Which statements mutate the value of the object that obj references? Which statements do neither? If necessary, you can read the documentation.

# obj = 'ABcd'
# obj.upper()
# obj = obj.lower()
# print(len(obj))
# obj = list(obj)
# obj.pop()
# obj[2] = 'X'
# obj.sort()
# set(obj)
# obj = tuple(obj)

# 1. Write a program named greeter.py. The program should ask for your name, then output Hello, NAME! where NAME is the name you entered:

# $ python greeter.py
# What is your name? Sue
# Hello, Sue!


# 2. Modify the greeter.py program to ask for the user's first and last names separately, then greet the user with their full name.

# $ python greeter.py
# What is your first name? Bob
# What is your last name? Roberts
# Hello, Bob Roberts!


# 3. Write a program named age.py that asks the user to enter their age, then calculates and reports the future age 10, 20, 30, and 40 years from now. Here's the output for someone who is 27 years old.

# How old are you? 27

# You are 27 years old.
# In 10 years, you will be 37 years old.
# In 20 years, you will be 47 years old.
# In 30 years, you will be 57 years old.
# In 40 years, you will be 67 years old.
